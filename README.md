## Overview:

We have been working to convince investors that bikesharing program in Des Moines would be a good place to start a new branch. In order to solidify the proposal, we have made a Tableau story to organize the data from our current programs to show the best way to start off in the new business venture.

## Results: 

### Use by Weekday hours: 
Based on the times of use shown by the charts, a majority of users use bikes for less than an hour, many for less than half an hour. They are also many people that use the bikes during the morning and afternoon hours of weekdays and throughout the day on Saturday. This tells us that people both use them to get to work and go home during the weekdays and for recreation during the weekend.

### Use by User types:
The data shows that based on the user type, people ride different amount of time. Customers ride for longer times which can indicate that they are riding for leisure. Subscribers use bikes for shorter amounts of time meaning that they are primarily using the bikes as transport. 

### How Gender affects use:
The charts tell us that it is the male group of consumers that are comprised of the people that primarily use the bikes for transport as they are the ones that are using the bikes for shorter amounts of time. It can also tell us that a majority of males that are subscribed use the bikes for transport needs.

## Summary: 

Based on results from the charts, we can see that bikes have multiple uses in metropolitan areas. When looking at these urban areas, people may choose to use these bikes to get places they need to go and also use them for leisure on their days off. There's also a majority of customers that choose to subscribe, especially if they regular use them transport, guaranteeing that there is demand in the area for alternative transport. Other visualizations that we could perform to find more data are the most popular starting points for rides and how user types affect where the rides end.
